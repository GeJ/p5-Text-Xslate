=head1 NAME

Text::Xslate::Loader - Loader Base Class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Text::Xslate::Loader is a base class for Loader classes, but it doesn't do
much by itself. You are also NOT REQUIRED to inherit from this class to make
your own Loader: You just need to provide a "load()" method for it to work.
This class is here because there are a few initialization-related methods
that are mostly common for Loaders.
